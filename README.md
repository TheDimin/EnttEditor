# EnttEditor
Editor for entt libary, using their build in reflection system


# What do we add

We add a layer ontop of entt's build in Reflection system allowing you to use these types inline.

With support of properties we can draw types any way we want.

We also provide you with a framework to add reflect any custom type allowing you to easily add support for drawing your own types to Imgui.
And add custom properties support by the types.
